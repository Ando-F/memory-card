### Memory Card
Memory Card is my first big React project. It is a memory game in which player gets points by clicking on images, but it is not allowed to click on any more than once. 

You can take a look at project description I had here: https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/memory-card.
